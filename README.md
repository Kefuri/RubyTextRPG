## Ruby Text-Based RPG ##

### Who?

Me!

### What?

See title!

### Why?

I'm building this as a way of refreshing my memory on following proper TDD process. Building software from scratch using TDD is different to building upon software with tests already in place that you can add to, and as such, I'm here building this project!
~~I'm also out of ideas on what to build next and this seems like a fun small project!~~
